Zhao Ziyang was the general secretary[^1] of the Chinese Communist Party from 1987 until he was deposed following his refusal to enforce martial law during the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest until his death in 2005.

Previously, he served as the 3rd premier[^2] of China from 1980 to 1987. He was enabled by Deng Xiaoping to carry out economic reforms following the traumatic tenure of Mao. While Deng was the enabler, Zhao was the architect of many of the reforms. His memoir is a unique source on contemporary Chinese political history. After expressing support for and advocating for dialogue with student protesters in 1989, he was exiled to house arrest.

How does this memoir exist? Around a decade after his exile, Zhao recorded audio tapes explaining his side of the student protest issue and his tenure over the reform and opening policies. These tapes were recorded in secret and smuggled out of the country via Hong Kong. He recorded over things like children's music and Peking opera tapes. The tapes were hidden in plain sight in his home, and he marked their order with faint pencil marks. 

His telling of events illustrates the degree to which CCP decision-making was guided by Marxist-Leninist dogma. It also shows a world of word games and court intrigue by which the fates of a billion people were decided. Ultimately, we may conclude that the 1989 military crackdown in Tiananmen Square was in some ways an internal coup against economic liberalization, the culmination of an ideological civil war that hardline communists felt they were losing. 

Today, Zhao is almost a non-entity in China. The state never publicly recognized him as under house arrest. Zhao gives the impression that too much acknowledgement of his situation was very undesirable for the party. He was allowed to travel within certain confines and make some visits, but it was all by the approval of the state and many of his requests were denied. His existence is acknowledged in a brief [Baidu Baike page](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%B5%B5%E7%B4%AB%E9%98%B3/170920) (the PRC's Wikipedia). It says that he benefited the country but that "comrade Zhao made grave errors during the 1989 political crisis." 

Zhao betrays strong moral convictions in his retelling of events. Even after defying the party and being condemned to house arrest, he continued to insist on the need for the party to recognize the validity of the 1989 protests and to make political reforms in letters to party leaders. He also made careful legal arguments against his house arrest, either out of desperation or naivety. 

Zhao is one of the few characters in his telling who seems to understand how essential free markets are for the well-being of the Chinese people. Yet he also seems steadfastly loyal to the party. It is possible that he simply didn't want to voice anything that would incriminate him as "anti-socialist," but his convictions as a socialist seem genuine in his telling. After all, to rise to party leadership one must go through a great deal of Marxist, Leninist and Maoist ideological education. It's hard to imagine making it to the top of the party if these ideologies were not genuinely held.

The memoir starts with his comments on Tiananmen and then shifts focus to internal politics and economic reforms. This is not chronological, and I think it's to the detriment of the story. Told chronologically, we see a common thread of liberals (as in economic liberals) vs. conservatives (as in conserving doctrinaire communism) that does much to illuminate the events in the final scene, the crackdown at Tiananmen.

I have boiled down this story into the bits that I found most interesting:

## Origins

Zhao, like Deng, was purged under Mao. He was party chief of Guangdong, having assumed the position in the early 50s, when he was purged by Red Guards at the onset of the Cultural Revolution for his moderate policies. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Ziyang#Early_career):
>Zhao worked with regional party officials to put in place arrangements that allowed peasants to profit from the sale of their crops. These projects were masked by ambiguous names such as "a control system for field management" to hide them from Mao, who would have forbidden the projects. According to Zhao, areas where these plans were implemented had a much lower death toll from famine.

When working in Guangdong, he learned that certain valuable breeds of rice could be exported and cheaper staple rice could be imported. This seems like a very plain economic concept to me, but Zhao seems to have learned it through the experience of directing the planned economy and taking an interest in feeding people. It is curious that he learned such lessons on his own in his ideological environment.

After being purged, he worked in a factory. His family ate meals from a suitcase on the floor used as a makeshift table. According to Zhao, one day Mao asked an assistant, "Whatever happened to Zhao Ziyang?" and when the assistant replied that he had been purged, Mao said, "Well, he was doing a good job, bring him back! We don't need to purge everyone, you know." The party chief of the factory roused him in the middle of the night, silently took him to the nearest airport hours away on a three-wheeled motorbike, the only vehicle available, and sent him to Beijing. He slept uncomfortably in a party hotel, accustomed to years of poverty and rough sleeping surfaces. When he met with Zhou Enlai the next day, he had a whole speech ready. He began to say "Y'know, I've been rethinking the Cultural Revolution..." when Zhou cut him off and told him he was being appointed party chief of Inner Mongolia.  

## Reforms Begin under Deng Xiaoping

Following the death of Mao, Deng Xiaoping assumed paramount leadership and backed Zhao Ziyang as premier and Hu Yaobang as general secretary in order to enact economic reforms. They were very successful, but the dramatic changes worried many hardline communists in the party. After Mao, everyone who had been purged was eager to implement the policy goals that they had been unable to implement under Mao. We can think of there being two factions at the top: liberals (reformers) and conservatives, who ran a spectrum of being opposed to Mao's methods but supporting his ideology or more fully endorsing Mao.  

Early in the 80s, the conservatives called for "anti-bourgeois liberalization campaigns," which were backed by Deng. It is unclear whether Deng was playing politics or actually believed in the need for these campaigns. 

Policies in China are often set by [intricate word choices](https://scholars-stage.org/the-slow-death-of-chinas-economic-paradigm/) that are promulgated down the leadership hierarchy, often via internal speeches or published in the media. So this campaign was effectively a series of widely published propaganda pieces and slogans meant to affect policy decisions at all levels of the government. When the "mass anti-liberalization cleansing movement" was getting out of hand, Hu Yaobang tried to minimize its impact by saying that actually it was merely a movement, sans "cleansing," meaning "don't get too crazy." But Deng Xiaoping had actually used the word cleansing in his original speech, so this undermined Deng and created a rift between him and Hu. 

## Zhao takes on a greater leadership role

This ultimately, along with an ill-fated interview in Hong Kong, led to Hu's dismissal. Zhao Ziyang did not want to suffer the same fate, so he carried out anti-liberalization movements. But he didn't actually want to do so, so he purposefully used confusing language in order to undermine the movement while paying it lip service. In his telling, Zhao says that he limited the campaign to dealing with internal party issues of education, politics and metaphysics. He specifically prohibited it from impacting the actual economic business of towns and villages. This angered the leftists, so Zhao had to pay them lip service while he figured out what to do. He would hold infrequent meetings to discuss the cases of people who were being persecuted, and if the discussions were inconclusive he would say that they must continue at the next meeting. Very few people were punished, according to Zhao. 

After Hu Yaobang was deposed, leftist party elders wanted to depose or demote his appointees. Zhao Ziyang navigated this by saying that guilt by association was a prohibited Cultural Revolution tactic. He paid lip service to the demands of leftists, but in private he insisted on severe limits to Deng Xiaoping. Anyone who was tolerable would remain, and even the intolerable ones would be removed slowly. He had to reform the party while going to lengths to appear that he wasn't.  

In 1982, prior to his dismissal, Hu Yaobang had characterized the country as in "the early stages of socialism" at the Party Congress. Zhao Ziyang borrowed the same phrasing at the 13th party congress[^3] in 1987. He purposefully did not define what this meant. The point was to pay lip service to socialism while making excuses for not adhering to absurd leftist dogma. 

Zhao sought to cement the reforms in the party's ideology. The transition away from economic totalitarianism suffered from a volatility problem. People cannot make long-term plans if they think things are volatile. The reforms in China were new, so people were apprehensive about committing to them with long-term plans. The reformers needed to show that the reforms were enduring changes. The party has departments dedicated to publishing "theory" and carrying out socialist education. So Zhao went about developing deep theoretical justifications for the economic reforms. He could have made an argument from a Marxist historical framework that capitalism needed to be developed more fully before socialism was pursued. But Zhao thought that would have been subject to intense debate, which he did not want. Instead, he sought to frame the reforms as proper socialism, but kept things vague in order to avoid debate.

## A leadership shuffle

Leading up to the 13th Party Congress in 1987, Deng suggested to Zhao that he wanted to step down from the Central Military Commission and let Zhao take over. He told Zhao that he thought that the other party elders had blocked too much reform and hoped that he stepped down then they might step down too. If Deng wouldn't step down, then why would they? Zhao begged him not to retire and said that he needed Deng's support, making the point that his influence wouldn't disappear with his retirement, and therefore wouldn't encourage others to retire.

With the dismissal of Hu Yaobang, a leadership shuffle was due at the 13th Party Congress. Communist ideologue Deng Liqun was a favorite of conservative party elders for appointment to the Politburo Standing Committee[^4]. Previously, he was in charge of propaganda works and curried favor with Li Xiannian and Chen Yun by publishing things like "Selected Quotations of Li Xiannian" and "Selected Quotations of Chen Yun." Those two elders pushed for his inclusion on the Politburo Standing Committee, but he did not even succeed at election to the Central Committee[^5]. This shows that the Central Committee members had some wits about them.

In order to avoid the appointment of a leftist to the position of general secretary, Zhao took over the position. He did not want to take the position as he enjoyed the work he was doing carrying out reforms as premier. Li Peng became the new premier. Li was from the conservative faction and opposed reforms. Apparently, save for Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, the reform faction had a hard time fielding people at the top, even with Deng's support.

## 1988, A Difficult Year

1988 was an important year in Zhao's and China's story. I will not give the full details here, but Zhao took a misstep in his reforms. The easing of price controls was sure to cause inflation, and Zhao accidentally fanned the flames of inflation by warning the public of inflation using state media. The expectation of inflation is enough to cause inflation, and a bank run ensued. This was a shock to Chinese markets, but one that was to be expected. Zhao acknowledged responsibility for missteps here, but also said that reforms should have been continued. 

Instead, Zhao was embarrassed and his political opponents seized the opportunity to gain the upper hand. Reform was stalled and a mass anti-liberalization campaign was carried out. Zhao was criticized internally by opponents like Li Peng and Yao Yilin. 

This is part of the backdrop of the student protests, which began as an anti-corruption, pro-reform movement in the face of this backtracking on reforms. The catalyst was the death of Hu Yaobang, whom the students understood to be a hero of reforms. The protests began when students gathered in Tiananmen Square to commemorate Hu's life. 

## 1989, Tiananmen 

In this summary I have mentioned two members of the conservative leftist faction: Li Peng and Li Xiannian. To me, the most fascinating aspect of Zhao's retelling of the Tiananmen incident is how these two, among others, seem eager to undermine Zhao before the situation has even gotten too severe. I stated above that the party elders who had been sidelined by Mao were all eager to see their ideas through after his death. Zhao said that Li Xiannian often said, "The economic successes are not all the result of reform. Weren’t there successes in the past, too? Weren’t the foundations laid in the past?" and "If whatever is being done now is all correct, then was the past work all wrong?" In Zhao's account of various reform and opening struggles, Li Xiannian and Li Peng are always opposed to his proposals.

As stated previously, Li Peng succeeded Zhao as premier when Zhao rose to general secretary. 

As the student protests began, Zhao was scheduled to visit North Korea. He got Li Peng's assurance that he would not raise the temperature, but as soon as Zhao left, Li and Yang Shangkun, another leftist elder, met with Deng on April 25th to persuade him that the situation was dire and could lead to full-scale revolt. It is worth noting that at this point, Deng Xiaoping was 84 years old. Zhao thought that Deng was quite impressionable at this age. 

In the meeting, Deng condemned the movement as anti-party. Zhao was called in North Korea. He said that he agreed with everything Deng said, but did so out of an abundance of caution because he didn't know what was actually happening in the country. Li Peng then published Deng's remarks in the infamous [April 26th editorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_26_Editorial). Deng and his family were angered that Li would publish his comments publicly, thrusting him to the front lines of a controversy. This angered students and reignited a protest movement that Zhao claims was already dying down. 

Wan Li, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress[^6], was on an official visit to Canada when a new round of protests broke out. Wan Li had sided with Zhao previously on toning down the government response. Zhao and others wanted him to return, and Li Peng expressed agreement. But Zhao says that in secret, Li Peng sent a message telling him not to return.

In Zhao's telling, Li Peng seems strikingly eager to cause a dramatic showdown with Zhao. Of course, Zhao is not a neutral observer, but given the backdrop of constant opposition towards and jealousy of the reforms, Zhao's telling feels intuitive.

Li Peng agitated strongly for a violent crackdown, but not all from the leftist faction who sought to undermine Zhao necessarily wanted a violent crackdown. Party elder Yang Shangkun said "How can we impose martial law on our capital?" Zhao believed that he had a moderate view. However, Yang eventually came around to supporting a violent crackdown.

The decision was made in mid-May. Zhao asked for a private meeting with Deng, but when he arrived he discovered that it was instead an enlarged Standing Committee meeting. Things had taken a turn for the worse. He meant to reassure Deng the the situtation was not severe without the meddling interference of leftist party members. Alas, the leftist faction was present and Wan Li was still abroad. Zhao expressed his views, roughly as follows:

> "The situation with the student demonstrations has worsened, and has grown extremely grave. Students, teachers, journalists, scholars, and even some government staff have taken to the streets in protest. Today, there were approximately 300,000 to 400,000 people. Quite a large number of workers and peasants are also sympathetic. Besides the hot issues of corruption and government transparency, the main impetus for all these different social groups is that they want an explanation for how the Party and the government can be so coldhearted in the face of hunger-striking students, doing nothing to try to save them. The key issue blocking dialogue with the students is the judgment passed by the April 26 editorial. The editorial, which caused so much misunderstanding, must have been unclear or incorrectly expressed in some way. The only way to bring about some kind of resolution would be to somewhat relax the judgment from this editorial. This is the key and, if adopted, will gain wide social support. If we remove the labeling of the student movement, we will regain control over the situation. If the hunger strike continues and some people die, it will be like gasoline poured over a flame. If we take a confrontational stance with the masses, a dangerous situation could ensue in which we lose complete control."

Li Peng and Yao Yilin immediately stood up and critcized Zhao. Zhao says that their lack of restraint suggested that they already had Deng's approval. In the end, Deng called for the imposition of martial law. He reaffirmed the correctness of the April 26th editorial and placed blame on Zhao's efforts to soften the party line for the intensified protests. A small committee was formed by Zhao opponents to carry out martial law. Zhao was not included, and later refused participation by taking three days of sick leave. 

All of this paints a picture of a party deeply conflicted. Many deicions and steps could have gone very differently with small interventions, in hindsight. To give one example that I haven't mentioned yet: Gorbachev made a state visit to Beijing on May 15th. During their publicized meeting, Zhao reassured Gorbachev that Deng was the leader of the party on important issues. He says that he normally said something like this and said so to Kim Il-sung in North Korea as well, simply to reassure other parties about China's ambiguous leadership structure. But in this case with Gorbachev, enemies pounced on this public statement and told Deng that Zhao was trying to shift blame for the student issue. Following the April 26th editorial, Deng was in the spotlight and students may have seen him as an enemy. Deng's family members were angry and called Zhao to express their dissatisfaction. 

Zhao's dismissal and the decision to enforce a violent crackdown could very well boil down to this one issue, among others. 

## Zhao's Dismissal

We know what happens next. On June 4th, the army and tanks were sent in. Zhao was soon thereafter dismissed from his post. What exact punishment he would suffer was subject to party discussion.

Zhao's dismissal was decided in an enlarged Politburo meeting. Deng permitted all to vote, which wasn't normal. Non-Politburo members normally could only listen. Zhao says this showed that Deng needed to muster more support. 

A central committee meeting was called to approve the enlarged meeting's decision. Zhao was told that his prepared statement would be passed out, but it was only passed out at the end and quickly collected. Criticisms of him were handed out at the beginning. The actual vote was done by a show of hands, instead of the normal secret ballot. This gives the impression that Deng was not certain that he had the support in the party. 

## Conclusion

There are a great many more details in the book. I kept my summary of the Tiananmen incident brief to avoid turning this into a book report. The chapter is worth reading as a companion to the 1995 documentary *The Gate of Heavenly Peace*. 

This book would not make a good movie; it's a story of policy and meetings, bureaucracy and politics, liberals and conservatives. There is no action. Yet, I see an enormous amount of excitement and action in these pages. China was truly close to a very different outcome in 1989. The path taken was a turning point. A decade of reforms and opening had led the country to a crossroads. 

Deng Xiaoping had always been clear about setting limits on political reforms. He told Zhao that there should "not even be a whiff" of moving towards a multi-party system with a tripartite separation of powers.  It is possible that with Deng at the helm, a confrontation like the one on June 4th was inevitable. It is also possible that this picture of a party on the edge of a decision is just a picture painted by Zhao, locked in his own house with nothing to do but reflect on events for a decade. 

But there is corroborating evidence, and the story is logical, so I am inclined to believe that, yes, China almost went down the right path. Zhao Ziyang comes off as a righteous hero. He was fiercely committed to his values, all the way to the end of his career and freedom. But more than just righteous, he was deeply pragmatic. Many of his decisions were made with deep pragmatic concern for the steering of China's great communist leviathan. He appreciated the risks and took great satisfaction in delivering for the Chinese people. He was, as far as I can tell, the single greatest leader of modern China. 

[^1]: The general secretary of the Politburo Standing Committee is the highest rank in the party, the leader of the party. When Mao was the leader, the position was called "chairman of the Politburo Standing Committee." They renamed the position to "general secretary" to distance themselves from the cult of personality around "Chairman Mao." Paramount power was informally held by Deng Xiaoping, who avoided titles after the traumatic tenure of Mao. 

[^2]: "Premier" means something more like head of state, so whereas the general secretary controls the party and ideological issues and can "set the stage," so to speak, for the entire country, the premier is in charge of economic affairs, like macroeconomic policy. 

[^3]: Party congresses are held every five years. They are important events where five-year plans are unveiled and leadership changes are made.

[^4]: The central party government is basically a set of concentric circles: The Central Committee (100-200 people), the Politburo of the Central Committee (23 people currently), and then the Politburo Standing Committee (where real power is held, ~5+ people).

[^5]:  Back then, these elections mattered. Today, the 205-member Central Committee is said to be largely a rubber-stamp organ following the directions of the Politburo Standing Committee. 

[^6]: The National People's Congress is a state organ, as opposed to a party organ. So, a rubber stamp organ, but one that Zhao envisioned a larger role for in political reforms.
