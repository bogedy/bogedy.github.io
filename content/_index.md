I'm Isaiah Kriegman. You can call me Isaiah, Isaías, 柯睿孟, or ישי. Currently a master's student in the math department at Bar-Ilan University. 

I'm a graduate of Haverford College 2020 where I majored in math with minors in statistics and Chinese. For my [senior thesis](https://github.com/bogedy/mcmc_thesis) I wrote an expository paper on Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation.
